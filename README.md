## 📂 Project Structure

### [Task 1: CNN for Malware Analysis](./task_1/)
* **Objective:** Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify malware based on binary-to-image conversion.
* **Files:** * `cnn_malware_analysis.py`: Python implementation of the CNN model.
  * `conv_net.md`: Detailed report on CNN layers (Convolution, Pooling, Fully Connected) and their role in pattern recognition for security.

### [Task 2: Transformer Architectures](./task_2/)
* **Objective:** Deep dive into the Transformer model architecture and its specific advantages for cybersecurity log analysis.
* **Files:**
  * `transformer.md`: Comprehensive report (200+ words) explaining Self-Attention, Positional Encoding, and context-aware threat detection.
  * `attention.png`: Visualization of the Q, K, V mechanism.
  * `position_encoding.png`: Heatmap of sinusoidal positional signals.
  * `architecture.png`: High-level Transformer Encoder-Decoder diagram.

### [Task 3: DDoS Detection via Regression](./task_3/)
* **Objective:** Utilizing Linear Regression to detect anomalous traffic spikes in server logs.
* **Files:**
  * `analysis.py`: Data science pipeline for log parsing, resampling, and regression modeling.
  * `ddos.md`: Analysis report identifying specific attack intervals based on statistical outliers (3x trend threshold).
  * `ddos_analysis.png`: Time-series visualization showing the regression baseline and detected DDoS spikes.
  * `server.log`: The raw data source used for the analysis.
